# Music Genre Classification ML ðŸŽµ

## Overview

This project aims to classify songs into **Hip-Hop vs Non-Hip-Hop** using audio features extracted from Spotify.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a song based on features like acousticness, danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Spotify Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geomack/spotifyclassification).  
It contains audio features for a wide range of songs along with their genre label (`target`).

## Current Work

- Data extraction and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Histograms of features
  - Skewness analysis
  - Boxplots and outlier detection
  - Comparison with normal distribution
- Outlier capping and preprocessing

---

## Next Steps

- Feature engineering
- Model training (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Building a web or desktop app for genre prediction
